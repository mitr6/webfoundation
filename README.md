## 🏛 About the Project

**FOUNDATION** is an experimental digital portfolio built at the intersection of software engineering and brutalist design. It is not just a showcase site, but an immersive experience emphasizing typography, micro-interactions, and fluidity.

The site's architecture is conceived as a physical space: robust, minimalist, yet full of fine details that reveal themselves as you explore.

## ✨ Experience & Features

This project integrates modern frontend development techniques to achieve maximum performance scores and a premium "feel":

* **🧈 Lenis Smooth Scroll** — Inertial, "buttery smooth" scrolling for cinematic navigation.
* **🌪 Page Transitions** — SPA (Single Page Application) navigation without abrupt reloads.
* **🧲 Magnetic Buttons** — UI elements that physically react to cursor position.
* **🎭 Parallax Effects** — Visual depth created through differential scroll speeds.
* **🌑 Thematic System** — Native Dark/Light mode with local persistence.
* **⚡ Vite Powered** — Instant builds and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
* **📱 Responsive Editorial Grid** — Asymmetrical layout that adapts perfectly from 4K to Mobile.
